Hello Challenger School Employer,

I am Nandita, I live in Fremont, CA with my husband and daughter. I am looking to work as my daughter left to full time school and COVID scare is ending.

I worked as a Software Engineer in India for 6+ years. Currently I am looking to work someplace near by and where I am efficiently contribute my hours as a computer Science graduate and still enjoy a work-life balance.

I am a fast study and am a good fit to the job, technology wise.

I am looking forward to talking to you about the job.
Thank You,
Nandita
